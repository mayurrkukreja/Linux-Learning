# Linux and its features

Linux is a Unix-like open-source computer operating system (OS) 
that directly manages hardware and resources of a system such as CPU, 
memory and storage and manages the communication between hardware and software. It was released on 
**5 October 1991 by Linus Torvalds** and is considered more secure and faster. 
It is freely distributable and is generally built around Linux Kernel. 
Furthermore, it can be installed in mobiles, laptops, computers, notebooks, etc.
